/**
 * Loads the Node fs promises API. Needed because on Node 10.17 and below,
 * fs.promises is experimental, and therefore not marked as enumerable. That
 * means when TypeScript compiles an `import('fs')`, its helper doesn't spot the
 * promises declaration and therefore on Node <10.17 you get an error as
 * fs.promises is undefined in compiled TypeScript land.
 *
 * See https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6548 for more details.
 *
 * Once Node 10 is no longer supported (April 2021) we can remove this and use
 * `(await import('fs')).promises`.
